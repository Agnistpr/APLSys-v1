To run, open terminal and enter the following commands: 
 - "npm install" (Install needed dependencies)
 - "npm run app" (Run the program)

npm Install usually takes 3 minutes
npm run app usually takes 2 minutes. If it remains stuck on "The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user..." for more than 2 minutes, open a new terminal and drun "npm run app" again.

Optionally, run "node dbd.js" to quickly seed the database for testing.
